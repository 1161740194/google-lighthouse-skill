# Lighthouse Reports Directory

This directory stores Lighthouse JSON reports.

## Naming Convention

Reports should be named with timestamps:
- `latest.json` - Symbolic link or copy of most recent report
- `2025-01-11-143022.json` - Timestamped reports

```bash
# Run against localhost
lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --output json --output-path .lighthouse/reports/latest.json

# Run against production
lighthouse https://example.com --output json --output-path .lighthouse/reports/production-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).json

# Run with specific categories
lighthouse https://example.com --only-categories=performance --output json --output-path .lighthouse/reports/perf.json
```

```bash
# Analyze latest report
gl analyze

# Generate fix suggestions
